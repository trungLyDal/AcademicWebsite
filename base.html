        <h3>Backstory:</h3>
    <p>
        Meet <b>John Doe</b>, a former nobleman turned scholar in the <b>war-torn</b> kingdom of <u>Dalhousie Land</u>. Amidst the chaos of relentless warfare, John emerged as a beacon of hope. He was driven by a singular mission: to restore the academic integrity that had been lost in his kingdom. Dalhousie Land, once known for its scholars and philosophers, had fallen into a state of decay, both physically and intellectually.
    </p>
    <p>
        John's journey was born out of witnessing the ruinous consequences of ambition and corruption of knowledge for personal gain. As the kingdom crumbled, he vowed to reunite his people through the pursuit of truth and wisdom, believing that true academic integrity held the key to healing his broken land.
